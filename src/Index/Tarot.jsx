            Tarot is a deck of 78 cards used for divination, self-reflection,
            and spiritual guidance. The deck is divided into the Major Arcana,
            which represents major life events, and the Minor Arcana, which
            reflects day-to-day experiences. Tarot readings involve shuffling
            the cards and drawing a set number to interpret their meanings based
            on their symbolism and positions. People turn to tarot for clarity,
            insight into life challenges, and to explore their emotional and
            spiritual state. While not meant for exact predictions, tarot serves
            as a powerful tool for self-discovery and guidance.
